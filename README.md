## Description:

A smartphone-controlled irrigation system created by Grade 12 STEM-EIT SHS Students from the University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos.

This study aims to address the lack of monitoring of the farmers with water irrigation systems in their fields, resulting in poor soil quality that
affects the production and quality of crop yields. Specifically, this study aims to construct a model of an automated irrigation system controlled by
an interactive smartphone application with the help of Arduino programming to manipulate the water flow, rate, and timing of water application to 
align with soil absorption and water-holding capabilities.
